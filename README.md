# Elasticsearch csv Ingest Processor

This processor can parse CSV data and stores it as individual fields.
This filter can also parse data with any separator, not just commas.

## Fork contribution

In this version the processor handles multiple patterns: it will consider the first one matching.
There is also an optional field, `key_field`, that allows to store the key value of the matching pattern.

## Installation

## Setup

In order to install this plugin, you need to create a zip distribution first by running

```bash
gradle clean check
```

This will produce a zip file in `build/distributions`.

After building the zip file, you can install it like this

```bash
bin/plugin install file:///path/to/ingest-csv/build/distribution/ingest-csv-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

## Bugs & TODO

* Need more test, like using separator and quote_char 
* and todos...
